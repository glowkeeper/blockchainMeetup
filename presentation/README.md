# How to Build the Presentation

The presentation in this folder - [beyondCryptos.md](./beyondCryptos.md) - relies on [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). It is built using [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/). If you wish to build the presentation yourself, then, to make things a little easier, I have a script that does all the heavy lifting for you - it is detailed here: [pandoc-build](https://github.com/glowkeeper/pandoc-build).
