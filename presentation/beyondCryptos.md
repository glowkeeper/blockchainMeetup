--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## An Egalitarian Society?

_Are blockchains how we can collaborate?_

## Premise

The mathematics of information security.

- **Public-key Cryptography (PKC)** - A form of encryption that creates a public key, which is shared, widely, and a private key, which is known only to the owner
- **Cryptographic Hash Functions** - Maps arbitrary data to a unique fixed-size string
- **Digital Signatures** - Identity authentication that allows users to digitally sign their messages

## Approach

**Design Science Research** (DSR), or, achieving understanding by building _artefacts_ that satisfy a set of functional requirements.

Although the creation of artefacts is critical, they are not the goal of DSR; instead, the focus is acquiring understanding.

## Artefacts

My artefacts demonstrate collaboration through toekenisation ([MicroMorpher](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Micromorpher)), provenance ([Provenator](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Provenator)) and humanitarian aid ([ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid)).

## Towards a PostCash Society

My article, [Towards a post-cash society: An application to convert fiat money into a cryptocurrency](http://dx.doi.org/10.5210/fm.v22i3.7410), discusses whether a blockchain-based tool, such as [MicroMorpher](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Micromorpher), might have helped the Indian government's 'demonitisation' process, which was legislation to remove 500 and 1,000 Rupee banknotes from circulation.

## The Transparency of Humanitarian Aid

At the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit (WHS), large humanitarian donors and aid organisations agreed to a "Grand Bargain" (GB) to improve the lives of people living in fragile situations because of crises. That made many commitments, including enhancing the transparency of mutual aid reporting, which it identified as having the potential to strengthen accountability, help decision-making and thereby, improve the effectiveness of humanitarian efforts.

## International Aid Transparency Initiative

The Grand Bargain adopted the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) as its standard open-data format for documenting aid finance.

## The Three T's of Transparency

A report following the Grand Bargain established the 3T's of transparency:

1. **Traceability**. The entire transaction chain of aid data must be traceable.
2. **Totality**. Financial information must be complete and relevant.
3. **Timeliness**. Aid information should be up-to-date

## A Need for Transparency

- Evidence from the U.K. suggests that transparency is necessary.
- The amount of humanitarian financing contributed by the U.K. is a result of the official development assistance target of 0.7% of gross national income. In 2015, that amounted to the U.K. spending Â£12.1bn
- That degree of funding has received much criticism. For instance, while giving evidence to a U.S. Senate Committee on foreign relations, ex-UK Prime Minister David Cameron said this:

_If what we do is just have continued programs for countries that sometimes fail year after year after year, we just keep going, maybe that's not a good use of our money_

## Trust?

However, did the Grand Bargain report miss a T?

**Trust** adds an indispensable quality to aid reporting; in this context, it means donors trusting that the reports contain information that is traceable, total and timely.

## The Four T's of Transparency

The proposal is that blockchain is the technology that can add a degree of trust when reporting humanitarian aid financing, thus helping to negate criticisms, such as those made above by Mr Cameron. That is because blockchains feature inbuilt mechanisms for addressing what I am now calling the '4Ts' of transparency:

1. **Traceability**.
2. **Totality**.
3. **Timeliness**.
4. **Trustworthiness**.

## Blockchain Implementation of the IATI Standard

[ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) is an MVP that implements the IATI standard and demonstrates blockchain's capability for addressing the 4Ts of transparency.

## Conclusions

> - [MicroMorpher](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Micromorpher), [Provenator](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Provenator) and [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) demonstrate that blockchains are the _technical_ means by which we can freely collaborate
> - The key to that is **TRUST**.
> - However...

## Conclusions (cont'd)

> - However, my thesis also discusses significant barriers towards the technology's wide-scale adoption
> - Not least of which is that blockchain's flat (non-hierarchical) architecture is not necessarily how (Capitalist) Society organises itself

## Future Work

> - Commons-based peer production and blockchain governance
> - My article for [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/uk) looks at [Bitcoin Energy Consumption](http://theconversation.com/bitcoins-high-energy-consumption-is-a-concern-but-it-may-be-a-price-worth-paying-106282), a concern I raised in my paper, [Socialism and the Blockchain](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi8040049)
